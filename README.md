# TEST-REPO
This *repo* was created as a way tp practice how git and github works in the initial days of **ALX**.

I promised `@Olusola` during last night's lesson to show how to fix the last part of the task `@Topman` *great guy* was working on. 

So first of all:

#### Here's a table created with markdown

**It goes like this**


|TASKS			|DESCRIPTION							|
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|1. Ordered Lists	|A number followed by a period `1.` creates ordered list	|
|2. Another list	|Same as first							|
|* Unordered list	|Created by inserting `*` or `-` or `+` in front of the list	|
|- Second list		|Same as above							|
|+ Third list		|Same still							|
|**Bold items**		|Makes items bold						|
|*Italics*		|Italicizes items						|
|_Italics again_	|Another ways of italicizing					|
|__Bold items again__	|Double underscores at both ends also bolds items		|
|~~N~~			|Double tildes at ends of a text will produce a strike through 	|

_Let's here for now, **`@Topman Great guy`** already **covered** all these and more_

###### So let's look at that last _task_
